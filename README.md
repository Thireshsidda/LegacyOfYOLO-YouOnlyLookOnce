# YOLO-YouOnlyLookOnce

### What is YOLO?
**You Only Look Once (YOLO):** Unified, Real-Time Object Detction is a single-stage object detection model published at CVPR 2016, by Joseph Redmon, famous for having low latency and high accuracy. The entire YOLO series of models is a collection of pioneering concepts that have shaped today's object detection methods.

YOLO Models have emerged as an industry de facto, achieving high detection precision with minimal computational demands. Some `YOLO models` are tailored to align with specific processing capabilities of the device, whether it's a CPU or a GPU. Most YOLO models are designed to cater to different scales, such as small, medium, and large, which can be easily serialized in ONNX, TensorRT, OpenVINO, etc. This gives users the liberty to choose which is best suited for their application.
