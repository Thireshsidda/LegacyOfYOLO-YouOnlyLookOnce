# Performance Comparison of of YOLO Object Detection Models

So far, we’ve thoroughly examined various models to understand their performance capabilities. However, there’s more to selecting the ideal model than just accuracy. Factors like inference speed on CPUs and GPUs, frames per second (FPS) rates, and choosing the right variant (Tiny, Small, Medium, or Large) are crucial for optimal model selection. A detailed `comparison of YOLO Object Detection Models` provides an invaluable resource in this regard. This comprehensive analysis dives deep into each model’s specifics, covering all these important aspects to help you get answers and decide.

If you are undertaking an object detection project, the probability is high that you would choose one of the many YOLO models. Going by the number of YOLO object detection models out there, it’s a tough choice to make on how to choose the best one. 

You may find yourself contemplating over: 

  - Which YOLO model to choose for the best FPS? 
  - What about inference speed on CPU vs GPU?
  - Which GPU to choose?
  - Tiny, Small, Medium, or Large model?
  - Which YOLO model is the most accurate? 

These questions become even more relevant when building real-world applications.
