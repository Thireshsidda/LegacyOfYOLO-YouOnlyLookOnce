# Comparison Between YOLOv5, YOLOv6, and YOLOv7

So far, we’ve thoroughly examined various models to understand their performance capabilities. However, there’s more to selecting the ideal model than just accuracy. Factors like inference speed on CPUs and GPUs, frames per second (FPS) rates, and choosing the right variant (Tiny, Small, Medium, or Large) are crucial for optimal model selection. A detailed `comparison of YOLOv5, YOLOv6, and YOLOv7` provides an invaluable resource in this regard. This comprehensive analysis dives deep into each model’s specifics, covering all these important aspects to help you get answers and decide.
