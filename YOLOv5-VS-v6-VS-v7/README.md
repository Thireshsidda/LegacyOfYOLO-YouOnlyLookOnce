# Performance Comparison of of YOLO Object Detection Models

So far, we’ve thoroughly examined various models to understand their performance capabilities. However, there’s more to selecting the ideal model than just accuracy. Factors like inference speed on CPUs and GPUs, frames per second (FPS) rates, and choosing the right variant (Tiny, Small, Medium, or Large) are crucial for optimal model selection. A detailed `comparison of YOLO Object Detection Models` provides an invaluable resource in this regard. This comprehensive analysis dives deep into each model’s specifics, covering all these important aspects to help you get answers and decide.

If you are undertaking an object detection project, the probability is high that you would choose one of the many YOLO models. Going by the number of YOLO object detection models out there, it’s a tough choice to make on how to choose the best one. 

You may find yourself contemplating over: 

  - Which YOLO model to choose for the best FPS? 
  - What about inference speed on CPU vs GPU?
  - Which GPU to choose?
  - Tiny, Small, Medium, or Large model?
  - Which YOLO model is the most accurate? 

These questions become even more relevant when building real-world applications. 

Our main objective in writing this `README` is to address the above questions by performing a thorough **performance comparison of the different YOLO object detection models**.This definitive guide will give you a complete and well rounded perspective of which model stands where in terms of its strengths, shortcomings and more.

For carrying out a comparative analysis  we choose the **YOLOv5, YOLOv6, and YOLOv7** families of models. We choose these models because these are the latest and some of the best YOLO models. Other comparable models YOLOX and YOLOR, we plan on adding them to this comparison if time permits.

The performance evaluation criteria will be based on 3 key points:

  -Accuracy of the models in terms of Mean Average Precision (mAP)
  -Speed of Inference in terms of Frames Per Second (FPS)
  -Type of GPU Used: Gaming or AI GPUs. **GTX 1080 Ti, RTX 4090, Tesla V100, and Tesla P100 GPUs** to be specific.

Along with the above, we will also uncover how the FPS of different YOLO models is influenced when using either a gaming GPU or an AI GPU for inference.

We will additionally provide you with answers to the most frequently asked questions on the YOLO models:

  -**Which YOLO model is the fastest on the CPU?**
  -**Which YOLO model is the fastest on the GPU?**
  -**Why do we encounter a decrease in FPS with Tiny/Nano models on some GPUs?**
  -**Which YOLO model is the most accurate?**
  -**Which are some of the best models to fine-tune from each, YOLOv5, YOLO6, and YOLOv7?**
 -** Which models are the best for small object detection?**
  -**How much GPU VRAM do I need for training YOLO models?**
