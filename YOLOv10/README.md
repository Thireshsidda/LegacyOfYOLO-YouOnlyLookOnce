### i) What is YOLOv10?
Three months back, Chien-Yao Wang and his team released YOLOv9, the 9th iteration of the YOLO series, which includes innovative methods such as Programmable Gradient Information (PGI) and Generalized Efficient Layer Aggregation Network (GELAN) to address issues related to information loss and computational efficiency effectively. But just like all other YOLOs, its reliance on the non-maximum suppression (NMS) for post-processing hampers the end-to-end deployment of the model and adversely impacts the inference latency. Additionally, the design of various YOLO components lacks comprehensive inspection, leading to unnecessary computation and reducing the model’s effectiveness.

So, like all other YOLOs, **Ao Wang, Hui Chen, et al.[1]** introduce the latest version of **YOLO(v10)** with some cool new features. So, what's new is YOLOv10? YOLOv10 comes with two main upgrades over previous YOLOs: a Consistent Dual Assignments for NMS-free Training and an Efficiency-Accuracy Driven Model Design to improve the overall performance. In the next section, let’s dive deep into these components to understand the root workflow of YOLOv10.


## Components of YOLOv10

YOLOv10 consists of two main components:
- 1) **NMS free training and inference
- 2) Efficiency-Accuracy Driven Model Design


Let's explore both of them one by one:
**Consistent Dual Assignments for NMS-free Training**

**Figure 2: NMS Workflow**

In traditional YOLOs, During training, they usually leverage **TAL(Task Alignment Learning)** to allocate multiple positive samples for each instance and non-maximum suppression (NMS) to remove redundant bounding boxes for the same object in post-processing. However, NMS can sometimes be a bit of a blunt instrument, potentially discarding useful predictions or failing to remove all duplicates efficiently. Also, it adds more computational cost during the time of training and inference. **DETR (DEtection TRansformer)**  introduces an elegant way to handle this issue by using the Hungarian algorithm for one-to-one matching during training, thereby eliminating the need for NMS during inference.

**Figure 3: YOLOv10 Model Workflow**

YOLOv10  authors introduced A new architecture to tackle the NMS post-processing with the help of DETR Architecture. It consists of two main components: a dual label assignment using two heads and a consistent matching metric to match both head predictions for a perfect prediction. Now, let’s move to the next section to understand both methods in detail.

## Dual Label Assignments
YOLOv10 combines the benefits of one-to-one and one-to-many matching strategies used during the training of object detection models. One-to-one matching assigns only one prediction to each ground truth, simplifying post-processing by eliminating the need for Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS). However, this approach can lead to weaker supervision, resulting in lower accuracy and slower convergence during training. To address this, YOLOv10 gives a dual-label assignment strategy that uses both one-to-many and one-to-one heads during training.

**Figure 4: Dual Label Assignment**

- **One-to-Many Head:** This head retains the original structure and optimization objectives and benefits the model by dense supervision. During training, it uses one-to-many assignments, which provide rich  supervisory signals(features) to the model.

-  **One-to-One Head:** This head uses a one-to-one matching strategy for label assignments, ensuring each ground truth is matched with a single prediction. It operates similarly to the Hungarian matching method but requires less training time. Using one-to-one matching eliminates the need for Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS) during inference, streamlining the prediction process.

In training, both heads are used simultaneously, allowing the backbone and neck of the model to leverage the comprehensive supervision from the one-to-many assignments. This improves the model’s learning and accuracy. The one-to-many head is discarded during inference, and only the one-to-one head is used for making predictions. This approach ensures that the model can be deployed end-to-end without additional computational costs, maintaining high efficiency in real-time object detection tasks.
